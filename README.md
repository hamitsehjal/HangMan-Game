#Hangman's Game

This Hangman's Game project showcases my skills in developing Java-based web applications using established methodologies and object-oriented design principles. The backend of the game was built using Java/JEE with Spring framework, ensuring scalability and efficient handling of user interactions. The game features a user-friendly interface created with JavaScript and Angular, enhancing the overall user experience by providing intuitive controls and real-time feedback during gameplay.
