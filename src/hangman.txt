I dont pay for suits My suits are on the house or the house burns down
Whiskey is good proofing water Tells you who is real and who is not
You can change what you do but you cannot change what you want
I am not a traitor to my class I am just an extreme example of what a working man can achieve
Everyone a whore Grace We just sell different parts of ourselves
You do not fuck with the Peaky Blinders
There is no rest for the wicked or the righteous
Sometimes violence is the only way to see if people are paying attention
You know I think we are gonna get along just fine Cause I like an honest enemy
It is not a good idea to look at Tommy Shelby the wrong way
